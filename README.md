# azure-ps
My playground for Azure Powershell

I'll be using this to keep my powershell scripts for learning the Azure SDK testing out some automation of it. I hope to set aside time to turn some of this into blog posts. Although most of what I put here will be precisely because of other's blog posts.

The `UseCmdlets` folder is for scripts where I use the individual Azure SDK cmdlets. Later I'm going to also do many of the same things with automation scripts.
